vehicle Damage Classification Using Deep Learning:
-------------------------------------------------------
A deep learning model built with FastAI and ResNet34 to classify car images into no damage, minor damage, and major accident damage categories.
 
 Overview:
 ----------------
This project uses computer vision to automatically assess the severity of car damage from images. It leverages transfer learning with ResNet34 and FastAI’s DataBlock API to build a robust classifier trained on a custom dataset.
The goal is to support applications such as:
- Insurance claim automation
- Vehicle inspection systems
- Car rental return checks
- Accident documentation tools

 Model Features
 ----------------
- Custom dataset with 3 classes
-  FastAI DataBlock pipeline
-  Transfer learning with ResNet34
-  Image augmentation for better generalization
-  End‑to‑end training + testing in a single notebook
-  Visual predictions with displayed images
